      want.  Rewrite it, restructure it, whatever.  If you can write software
      that makes money off of it, good for you.  I kinda like capitalism. 
      Please don't blame me if it causes your $30 billion dollar satellite
      explode in orbit.  If you redistribute it in any form, I'd appreciate it
      if you would leave this notice here.
